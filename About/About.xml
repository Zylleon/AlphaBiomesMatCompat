  <description>Patches the stone, wood, and metal from Alpha Biomes to also count as their vanilla equivalents.

This means:
* Anything that uses "any wood" can now be made with red wood, crystaline wood, and mushroom stalks
* Anything that uses "any stone" can now use alpha biomes stone
* Metal items can use alcyonite chunks.
* New maps can spawn ruins made of Alpha Biomes materials
* Anything from Alpha Biomes that requires these materials, like the exotic walls, will continue to work normally

Mushroom stalk fences! Mushroom war masks! Mushroom plate armor! Cragstone braziers! Mushroom herb boxes! Mushroom thrones! Mushroom cribs! Mushroom axes! Rose quartz stuff, I guess, if you're weird.

This mod is NOT affiliated with Alpha Biomes. Dont complain to them about this mod, complain to me.
